Functionalities: 

The main functionalities that would use this database could include:

Product search: Users could search the site using keywords or filters to find products they want to purchase. This feature would require access to the product database to return relevant results.

Adding products to the cart: When a user finds a product they want to purchase, they could add it to their virtual cart. This feature would require access to the product database to retrieve product information and the user database to store cart contents.

Order processing: When a user finalizes their order, the website should access the database to retrieve product and user information and store the order details.

Order tracking: Users should be able to track the status of their order, such as delivery status or shipping updates. This feature would require access to the order database to retrieve order information and the delivery database to store tracking information.

Database:

The database design that I proposed for an e-commerce website provides a robust solution for storing information about products, users, orders, and delivery tracking information. This design uses primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables, which allows for data integrity and ease of maintenance.

The products table stores information about each product, including its name, description, price, stock, image, and category. This table is essential for displaying products on the website and allowing users to search for and order products that interest them.

The users table stores information about each user, including their username, email address, password, shipping address, and phone number. This table allows users to create an account on the website, store their personal information, and place orders.

The orders table stores information about each order, including the user ID who placed the order, order date, order status, and order total. This table is essential for tracking user orders and processing payments.

The order products table stores information about the products that were ordered in each order, including the order ID, product ID, and quantity ordered. This table allows products ordered to be linked to a specific order, enabling stock tracking and more efficient order processing.

Finally, the delivery tracking table stores tracking information for each order, including the order ID, delivery date, delivery status, and tracking information. This table allows users to track the status of their order and see real-time tracking information.

Overall, this database design provides an effective solution for storing essential information for an e-commerce website. However, it should be noted that database design can vary based on the specific needs of the website and its functionalities and may require adjustments or modifications over time to meet changing requirements.
